Peter J Usherwood's personal data science repository
========================

Welcome to my personal data science repository. My name is Peter Usherwood I am a professional data scientist
https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-usherwood/

This repo is a collection of various pieces of my work. There is no further theme to this repository; some pieces of
work will be moved into separate packages when they are complete to be used as stand alone products, others are
scripts just intended for my research.

There are no docs for this project given the nature of its contents, a brief overview of what can be found here is
given below. All of it is my own original work, and can be used in compliance with the licence attached:

- main: a package of .py files in a OO or functional style containing the bulk of my developed code and research

    - df_creator: a package to create pandas df instantiated with model data for all application.
    - neural_networks: research into neural nets including a numpy implementations of a FFN, and scripts for convolution networks
    - nlp: series of nlp scripts including a modified n_grams code to use POS tuples
    - tools: other code useful in a variety of applications

- tutoriais: a series of jupyter notebook tutorials teaching the basics of Python and data science in Portuguese

- sample_notebooks: procedural examples of how to run more complicated pipelines using work contained in main

- data: data that scripts in other directories will require to run, including stopword lists, corpus, and trained machine learning models
